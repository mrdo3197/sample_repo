# Analyzing Gamezone's Revenue Drivers and Marketing Efficiency

# Project Background
**Gamezone**, founded in 2018, is a global retailer of new and refurbished gaming products, operating primarily through its online store and mobile app. The company leverages a variety of marketing channels to drive customer acquisition and sales.

Despite possessing extensive sales data, this information has historically been underutilized. This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of that data to uncover actionable insights aimed at enhancing Gamezoneâ€™s commercial strategy and operational efficiency.

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify key revenue drivers and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing efforts. The findings will support strategic decision-making to optimize marketing spend, improve platform performance, and maximize product profitability.

Insights and recommendations are provided across the following key business areas:

- **Sales Performance and Trends:** Historical and seasonal analysis of revenue, order volume, and Average Order Value (AOV) from 2019 to 2021.
- **Marketing Channel Effectiveness:** Evaluation of revenue contribution and customer value by marketing channel to guide budget allocation.
- **Platform Comparison:** Assessment of sales performance and customer behavior across the Mobile App and Online Store.
- **Product Analysis:** Identification of top-performing and underperforming products, including analysis of new versus refurbished sales mix.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

Gamezone's order data is housed in a single table, ```gamezone_orders_data``` containing 21,864 records, with each record representing a unique line item on a customer order.

The core measures driving business analysis are:

- ```usd_price```: The monetary value of each transaction.
- ```purchase_ts``` and ship_ts: Timestamps used to calculate sales trends and operational efficiency metrics like fulfillment_time_days.

The key dimensions for segmenting and analyzing these metrics include:
- ```product_name``` and ```product_id```: For product performance analysis.
- ```purchase_platform```: To distinguish user behavior between the Mobile App and Online Store.
- ```marketing_channel```: For attributing revenue and evaluating channel effectiveness.
- ```country_code```: For geographical sales analysis.

The data spans from 2019 to 2021, enabling a comprehensive review of annual and seasonal trends.

Prior to analysis, the dataset underwent a rigorous validation and cleaning process to address inconsistencies in date formats, categorical values, and missing data, ensuring the reliability of all subsequent insights. The SQL queries used for inspection and quality control can be found here.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
