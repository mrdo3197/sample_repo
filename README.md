# Project Background
**Gamezone**, founded in 2018, is a company that sells new and refurbished gaming products worldwide, primarily through its online store. It also has a mobile app and leverages a variety of marketing channels.

- **Product Level Performance:** An analysis of Gamezone various product lines, understanding their impact on sales and returns.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

There is also supplementary information about platform used to make the order and geographical data such as country. The data spans over a period ranging from 2019 to 2021.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
